In this, my first project, I will try to copy Google's homepage. See you in a few hours!

I finished the project and I'm actually pretty satisfied witht the result. I could've copied it to a T, but I feel that at this point of my learning it wouldn't be worth it and I would end up not gaining much. Obviously aiming for sophistication is not my main goal right now.
